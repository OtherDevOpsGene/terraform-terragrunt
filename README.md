# terraform-and-terragrunt

A half-day course to introduce some fundamental concepts and practices for
HashiCorp Terraform and Gruntwork Terragrunt.

By the end of the half-day, you should have an appreciation for how Terraform
works, how to perform some basic tasks, and why you might use an additional
layer like Terragrunt.
